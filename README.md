# BrandColors Feedback

If you wish to suggest a new brand, report a bug, or pitch a new feature idea for [BrandColors](http://brandcolors.net/), this is the place to do so. Please create an issue and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

If for whatever reason you wish to contact me privately or have no idea how to create a GitHub issue, I may also be emailed at <galen@galengidman.com>.

Thanks.
