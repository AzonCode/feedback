### How to find colors

A good place to look for brand's colors is in their logos. Sometimes you'll get lucky and stuble across a handy brand or identity guidelines document that lists them all along with their HEX value, but usually your best bet is just pull the colors right out of the logos.

A few things to keep in mind:

- The higher resolution the logo the better. They're usually less distortred which can sometimes affect color.
- You can often find high resolution logos on company's Press or About pages. Poke around a bit, they're usually there.
- Try to pick the color out of a flat section of the logo — gradients are bad.
- Sometimes color picker apps are slightly incorrect. Instead, open the image in a photo editor like Photoshop and use that color picker.
- If multiple colors are there, include them all in your issue.
- When you submit your issue, let me know where you got the color and how. If, for example, you're a designer at XYZ Corp and know your company's exact brand color, telling me that will save me a lot of time since I won't have to double-check things.
